## Documentation

You can now access the documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/peeweek/net.peeweek.vfxgraph-extras/wiki)

## Installing

You can use a manual, local package installation if you need to alter the code locally or automate the fetch of the repository by using a git address directly. The latter option shall download and manage automatically the repository, with the drawback of being read-only.

### OpenUPM Scoped Registry (2020.1 and newer)

Open Project Preferences and go to Package manager Window.

If not present, add this scoped registry:

* Name: **OpenUPM**
* URL : `https://package.openupm.com`
* Scopes : `net.peeweek`

Once added, you can close the project settings window.
